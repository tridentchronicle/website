                <h4>1. A Quick Technology Background</h4>
                <p>
                    Blockchain is a distributed database that is write-only. No update is allowed. It holds a continuously growing list of records
                    that are ordered by time and organized into arbitrary groups, called blocks. Each block has a link to the previous
                    block. The link value often is a hash of the previous block, signifies the integrity of its predecessors. The
                    records contained within each block are usually transactions between parties, but it can be any piece of information
                    that we want to protect. It’s guaranteed that what is written, once, won’t be tampered with.</p>

                <p>
                    <strong>There are two main attributes that make blockchain truly decentralized and usable for financial transactions
                        or for contracts between two or more parties:</strong>
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Each block is sealed by "proof-of-work" called key. These keys are very special. It requires massively intensive computation
                        to come up with one -- hence the name. In fact, with all the mining going on in the world of bitcoin, only
                        one key comes up every roughly 10 minutes. Whoever comes up with the next key first can seal all the open
                        records into a block (and get some commision for doing so). Then the new block starts.</li>
                    <li>
                        Consensus by the majority of record holders, called nodes, decides the outcome of any conflict. The chain that agrees with
                        majority wins. In a truly distributed world, there could be delays that give rise to multiple racing chains
                        (fork out), the longest (that with the most proof of work) fork out wins.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    <strong>What this means is that if someone wants to alter the historical data, they have to:</strong>
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Go back into the old block, make that change</li>
                    <li>
                        Come up with all the keys to reseal that block and ALL subsequent blocks to support the “new” integrity. If you only change
                        that block, the hash contained in the subsequent block will not match. You also could drop the subsequent
                        blocks, but that won’t work because other hosts will always pick the longest validated chain. Thus you need
                        to do one more thing</li>
                    <li>
                        Get the majority of nodes to agree with this new chain
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Proof-of-work allows data (usually ledgers and contracts) to be openly shared, and yet secured against tampering.
                    Cryptocurrencies are successful examples of blockchain. They are maintained by a set of public computers -- some
                    are serving the ultruristic goal, others are incentivized by earning commissions for mining key to seal the blocks.</p>


                <h4>2. The Problem with Proof-of-Work (PoW)</h4>
                <p>
                    Proof-of-work requires lots of hardware computing resources to perform key mining. The good participants together have to
                    be the majority, otherwise, the blockchain is vulnerable and is prone to be taken over by someones or groups
                    with more powerful computing resources.</p>

                <p>
                    "Proof-of-work" cannot be simple. Its difficulty level is adjusted depending on the number of mining nodes. It is designed
                    so that blocks are slowly added to the blockchain. Without the super heavy (and slow) proof-of-work, the public
                    blockchain is not secured.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If however, you make the blockchain private between a limited number of trusted parties then you may let go the "proof-of-work".
                    You could use "majority-vote" or other algorithms to resolve any conflicts.
                </p>



                <h4>3. Hybrid Blockchain Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                    We are introducing a Hybrid Blockchain Technology (HBT) as a set of API Services and Database plugins. Private parties can
                    employ HBT to host their immutable record chains. It is efficient and hack-proof.</p>

                <p>
                    HBT manages the private blocks using "weighted-voting" algorithms. Every so often it sends its checksum into the public blockchain
                    to mark the blocks immutable with the public "Proof-of-work" from miners (such as that of Bitcoins or Ethereum).
                </p>

                <p>Validator modules can be set up to check the integrity of data every so often. It’s configurable, cost-effective,
                    super scalable, and fast!</p>
                <p>
                    As of September 2018, the bitcoin public blockchain size has already reached 185 GB. Every replica on the participant network
                    holds a complete copy of this data. Blocks are formed every 10 minutes. It is simply big, inefficient, and slow!
                    All public blockchains, by design, will face this same issue.</p>

                <p>
                    Not every single activity among the private parties need to be made public to uphold the trust among them. HBT system can
                    be used to hold private contracts, thus they are secured, fast, and scalable. The blocks’ signatures are sealed
                    by public blockchain so their integrity is guaranteed.
                </p>
                <p>
                     Blockchain adds the level of trust that only public blockchain possesses to your existing systems without requiring
                    the entire system redesign. It minimizes the typically-forbidden data migration cost and the massive disruptions
                    to business’s day to day operations.

                <h3>4.  Blockchain Advantages</h3>
                <h4>4.1 Speed and Immutability</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>No proof of work is required for private blocks</li>
                    <li>Periodically blocks’ hash would be sealed by public blockchains. </li>
                    <li>It’s scalable, fast, and immutable.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>4.2 Distributed and Secure</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can create any number of Nodes as publisher or subscriber or both. </li>
                    <li>Nodes can be configured to be randomly distributed on AWS, Google or Azure or any Datacenter, with individual
                        private algorithms and keys to uniquely protect the blocks data. Hackers will have to hack all the nodes
                        to be able to mutate any block which is not yet hashed to the public blockchain.</li>
                    <li>Those whose hashes are already published to public blockchains are immutable and as hack proof as public blockchain
                        with proof-of-work (such as Bitcoins or Ethereum).</li>
                    <li>Consensus algorithm (such as weighted-voting right) are configured for resolving any conflict very efficiently.
                        This is similar to quorum on BigTable or other NoSQL technology in the eventual-consistency paradigm.</li>
                </ul>


                <h4>4.3 Simple and Non-disruptive System Integration</h4>
                <p>
                    Trident Chronicle blockchain strategy adds public backed immutability to your existing system’s record keeping. It’s an add-on model
                    that allows gradual integration into any existing system. It starts with adding basic integrity checkpoints to
                    your data which provides public proof that your private data is secured and hasn’t been tampered with. The hybrid
                    layer can over time act as the monitoring system, conducting periodic & automated audits. Result of audits can
                    also be sealed by public blockchain.</p>

                <p>

                    Trident Chronicle blockchain system would employ a set of simple and standardized programming & design principles and practices.
                    It features the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>API Services</li>
                    <li>DB Plugins</li>
                    <li>Configurable Auto Validator Modules</li>
                </ul>
                That’s all you need to make it happen.

                <h4>5. Trusted Product Journey</h4>
                <p>
                    Products’ track & trace is a mandate by many governments. It is also important for a business to know the flow of their products
                    and components. For high-end products, Blockchain can add public-backed trust to this data so that peer businesses
                    or end consumers have the warranty that their product is genuine and has gone through the proper checks and certification,
                    on a legit distribution network. It can be done via HBT.</p>


                <h4>5.1 Constraints of a public blockchain</h4>
                <p>
                    Tracking the journeys of billions of products using public blockchain is just not going to happen. It’s simply not practical
                    and not even possible!
                </p>

                <h4>5.1.1 From the data size perspective</h4>
                <p>
                    We’re talking about terabytes (TB) of data or even petabytes (PB) for large brands. Public blockchain is already struggling
                    at 196GB. The public blockchain is trustable because each participant has a complete copy of the data. There
                    are at least 100,000 bitcoin miners out there. They’re not going to be able to replicate your TeraBytes every
                    so often.</p>

                <h4>
                    5.1.2 From the speed perspective</h4>
                <p>
                    Products in the distribution network and retailers constantly move. There are millions of moves every minute. Public blockchain
                    can’t handle these many ledgers! For example, bitcoins can only handle around 3-7 transaction per second.</p>
                <h4>
                    5.1.3 From the cost perspective</h4>
                <p>
                    Miners work for coin but in the long run, it’s the commission earned on a transaction that keeps them going. End of the day
                    we need their hard earning computing power to seal the trust among unrelated parties. No-one can afford to pay
                    the commission for billions of transactions a day. </p>

                <h4>
                    5.1.4 The impossibility X 1000</h4>
                <p>
                    Whatever we plan to do with public blockchain, there are at least a thousand others (if not millions) are trying to do similarly.
                    Everyone wants to write to public blockchain. Uber trust is a scarcity and comes with high price. The price of
                    trust is proportional to the price of the bitcoin. The more people using it, the scarce the resource, the higher
                    the price!</p>

                <h4>
                    5.2 Achieving Immutability</h4>
                <p>
                    Your private data now is trustable if it matches the checksum that you published early on the public blockchain. That is
                    the proof that the data hasn’t been tampered with. Therefore publishing the checksum is sufficient. The bigger
                    the checksum the more it is trusted. A 128 or 256-byte checksum is already very trustworthy.</p>

                <p>
                    Immutability = Trust
                    <br/> “It is what we said it is, sealed by public trust!”
                </p>

                <p>Hybrid Blockchain Technology(HBT) solves this very problem! As products or components move, assembled or repackaged,
                    we can track them using your existing database or Trident Chronicles’ track and trace cloud backend. Every so often we’ll
                    calculate the checksum and back up the data into private immutable storage. The checksum then sent to the public
                    blockchain. Later if you or your peer parties want to validate your data, just check it against the checksum.
                    It is that simple.

                </p>


                <h4>5.3 Achieving Scale</h4>
                <p> HBT is one of a very few ways to achieve peer trust in any large scale highly active data system. Your database or
                    Trident Chronicle’s cloud backend can operate normally at its hyper speed without any constraints. Computing checksum
                    can be done continuously in parallel or every so often on the side. It’s a standard and linear algorithm which
                    is fast. If necessary, we can compute multiple checksums for different data segments in parallel then compute
                    another checksum on top. This distributed model isn’t limited at 2 layers. You can create any chain-of-trust
                    and it will be trustable as long as each checksum is 128-characters long and the root checksum is backed by public
                    blockchain. It’s very similar to how DNS works. </p>

                <h4>
                    5.3 Easily Configurable</h4>
                <p>Besides being fast and effective, HBT is also totally configurable depending on your need and budget. You can configure
                    how often you want to publish to the public blockchain, and how big the checksum is.</p>


                <h4>6. Conclusion</h4>
                <p>
                    There is no magic in the blockchain. We need to know the costs and benefits. Blockchain is a great technology if we use it
                    effectively. Hybrid Blockchain Technology is a simple, yet a powerful portal to export the trust of private data
                    systems to the world.</p>
